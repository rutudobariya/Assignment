        <h1 class="font-bold">Q : 1 ) What is Redux ? </h1>
        <p><b>Ans :</b> <br> Redux is used in react for state management. We devide our react app in different
            components so if
            we
            need
            to transfer data between two componets it can be done through props but sometimes it can be very complex we
            call
            it props drilling. to avoid props drilling we use redux as a state management so we can use any data
            anywhere
            there is a store in redux where all data is stored
        </p>

        <h1 class="font-bold">Q : 2 ) What is Redux Thunk used for? </h1>
        <p><b>Ans :</b> <br>Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that lets you return functions instead of actions.
            This
            allows for
            delayed actions, such as working with promises. Redux Thunk is used to manage the state of React
            applications.

        <h1 class="font-bold">Q : 3 ) What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over
            Component?</h1>
        <p><b>Ans :</b> <br>
            Pure components only re-render when their props or state change. They do not re-render when the value of
            state and props has been updated with the same values.
            <br>
            You can use PureComponent when: <br>
            A component's output solely depends on its state and props <br>
            There are no side effects, such as network requests or interactions with the DOM <br>
            Your React component's render() function renders the same result given the same props and state <br>
        </p>

        <h1 class="font-bold">Q : 4 ) What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is
            its purpose ?
        </h1>
        <p><b>Ans :</b> <br>
            The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a callback function which gets called
            immediately after the setState is completed and the components get re-rendered.<br>
